This project is a mobile application project that focuses on recipe finding, based on the ingredients available at that time. This project is designed specifically for the Final Year Project and was built using Android Studio, with a Web scraping technology using Node.js. Users would input the ingredients available and click on the "Search" button. The Search Results would then be displaying the results of the recipes that had match the users' input. In order to make sure the application is running smoothly, functional testing in manual testing is used. Postman was also used in order to test scripts of the requests. As a side note, the recipes are extracted using Web scraping technology from 3 different websites and are then saved into a database (MySQL Workbench). The web scraping and the application are two separate entities, and it could be combined with the help of PhpMyAdmin (XAMPP) by exchanging the port number for MySQL. Please note that on this Github, only the codes for Web Scraping is available, and not the codes for the application.
